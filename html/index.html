        <h4>Personal loan</h4>
        <p>Personal loans are convenient, as you can use them for a variety of expenses, including medical bills, weddings, home improvements, vacations and unexpected emergencies. Personal loan rates currently range between 4% and 36% depending on several factors. Rates typically fluctuate from one provider to the next, and the lowest rates are reserved for those with higher credit scores.

    </div>
    <div class="flex2">
        <h4>Life insurance</h4>
        <p>The insurance company covers your financial risks. In exchange, you are required to pay a fee. Under this contract, the insurance company promises to pay a sum of money to your family members in the event of your death.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="flex3">
        <h4>Credit cards</h4>
        <p>cardholders earn extra rewards, such as cash back, points or miles, when they use their card. To earn the bonus, you usually have to reach a minimum spending requirement within the first few months of opening your account.</p>

    <div class="container3">
    <div class="flex4">
        <h4> Student loans</h4>
        <p>As you make payments on your student loan, your balance and the amount of interest you accrue will drop. While your first payments after disbursement will primarily go toward the interest, more of your payments are applied to your principal over time.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="flex5"><h4>Travel insurance</h4>
    <p>Travel insurance provides financial protection if you face certain problems when you're travelling or on holiday. It covers a range of possibilities, from lost luggage to the cost of medical care if you become ill or have an accident.
    </p></div>
    <div class="flex6">
        <h4>Savings account</h4>
        <p>
            A savings account is an interest-bearing deposit account held at a bank or other financial institution. Though these accounts typically pay only a modest interest rate, their safety and reliability make them a good option for parking cash that you want available for short-term needs.</p>
